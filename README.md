### Description

A very small dll 28Kb (compiled) that makes the programmer more productive (if i should say myself) by combining common functions used in most of our daily programming needs. Every wanted to drag a borderless form? or make that textbox accept only numbers? or capital or small letter without having to hold shift or press the caps lock key??? or have a searchable combo box as you type?? or how about ciphering passwords and usernames for logins?? Feel free to look up this FREE program of mine. It uses some of the APIs of windows to achieve these tasks. I myself am using this for my projects VB and ASP. Feel free to use it.. you have my consent :) just dont forget to rate for me. ok? any suggestions are very much appreciated. If you want some tutorial regarding the use of the control please send me an email and ill try to reply you in the soonest possible time. See ya.
